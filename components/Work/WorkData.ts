Having been part of a fantasy basketball league for several years, I found that there was no box score website that was quick and simple to scan to get player statistics. The NBA and ESPN box scores required too much clicking to go from game to game to view player stats, so I decided to create a simple app where me and the other members in our fantasy league could quickly scan all the games and get the important necessary statistics for each game. The game cards are clickable and will scroll directly to the relevant game score box. The box scores were designed to imitate the Yahoo fantasy basketball stats layout so that they could be scanned easily, and the columns are sortable to add even more efficiency in getting the data that is needed. This app consumes the MySportsFeed API service to get the game and player data. Currently, the app is only serving data after the game, not live data, and only data for the 2019-2020 season is provided. The API is wrapped in a proxy server using NodeJS and Express.
